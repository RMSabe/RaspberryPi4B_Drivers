# RaspberryPi4B_Drivers
These are some drivers for hardware control on the Raspberry Pi 4B peripherals.
I made them on Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) arm64. I haven't tested it on Raspberry Pi OS armhf or any other OS.
I believe these will compile and run on Raspberry Pi OS armhf, since it's the same hardware and GNU-Linux distro, (Raspberry Pi OS, BCM2711).
I don't know if they will compile on other GNU-Linux distros, as their kernel headers might be incompatible to these code files.

I'm not a professional software developer. Everything here was made just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from these codes.
